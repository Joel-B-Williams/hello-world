#This is a document for yet more practicing git and github flow!!

**This is very important**
 * _Add new documents_
 * _Commit all changes_
 * _Merge to master_
 * _Push that noise_

 ### Kindly Note

 I may be pushing other branches up to Github just to practice merging both locally and remotely.  Also helpful if there's a sub-master branch for a given project that will later be merged to the master.
